# An Analysis of Employee Data for Pewlett Hackard

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Pewlett Hackard's employee data to help the company plan for the future retirement of employees. Using the relationships between six different data sets we deterimined both the number of retiring employees by title and employees who are eligible to participate in their mentorship program.

## Results

Four major points can be taken away from the two analysis:
- The retirement_titles table shows every employee eligible for retirement and how long they have been at the company for.

- The retiring_titles table categorizes these employees by title, and the vast majority of retiring employees hold a "senior" title (50,842 employees out of 72,458).

- The mentorship_eligibility table shows that there are 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program, most of whom hold senior titles.

## Summary

As the "silver tsunami" approaches, the company should be prepared to replace 72,458 employees over the next 4 years. With only 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program, Pewlett Hackard may need to broaden their criteria for mentorship elegibility in order to keep up with the new hires that will be needed.
